For this project we need to use the following libraries:

Tensorflow: for the implementation of the models and saving of them
Pandas and os: For working with files and directories
Numpy: for multiple operations with arrays

I decided to divide the project in multiple steps:

1. Observing the data and finding what the data actually means
2. Finding ways to implement an algorithm for the problems that we are facing
3. Performing data preprocessing and dividing it into training and testing sets
4. Important factors for MHG
5. Important factors for GY
